part 1:
1. In the evening, i enjoy staying at home. I think most young people will go out to relax in the evening, which will cause traffic jams and sometimes traffic accidents caused by jaywalkers.
2. In the weekend, i usually spend time to playing game, to do homework or listen to music. Iâ€™m so lazy so  I rarely play sports.
3. I rarely take the bus because my parents bought me a bicycle to go to school. However, when I have to go far and can't cycle, I will take the bus.
Part 2:
Today I will talk about a party that I like. I remember that day was my 18th birthday. It was on a rather intense sunny afternoon, while I was sitting at my desk studying for the upcoming university exam, my friends suddenly brought a birthday cake and candy to celebrate my birthday. At that time, I felt really happy that my friends remembered my birthday. The party was held at my house. After cutting the cake and blowing out the candles, we sat and talked and confided together until late in the evening when my friend left. Although this is not a big party, I feel very funny. I thought my 18th birthday would pass in vain but thanks to my friends who made it so meaningful to me. Until now, thinking back, I still feel very happy.
